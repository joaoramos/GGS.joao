Boilerplate code for my projects. It's based on:

- **[Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)**: cross browser consistency;
- **[Golden Grid System](http://goldengridsystem.com/)**: an awesome fluid-width grid system;
- **[320andup](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/)**: used for some CSS defaults and media queries;
- **[LESS Elemen](http://lesselements.com/)**: great set of mixins.
